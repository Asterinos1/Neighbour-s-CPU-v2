# Changes made to part1:
1. Control -> Removed the function compareVectors, added an FSM as requested
2. Decode -> Added an extra module "equal_comparator" to replace the previous function
3. Dapath -> Added registers to hold the outputs between stages (IF-DECODE-EXECUTE-MEMORY) and adjusted signals accordingly
