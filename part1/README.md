## Important notes ##
- In the project description (2024 version) it was asked not to implement 'sb' instruction. However we didn't notice this on time and did it nonetheless
- You have to import all files contained in **vhdfiles** and **packages** directories, then create the RAM/ROM memories using IP Core Generator and add one of the coe files in RAM.
- Run PROS_SB testbentch and then while on ISIM, click File -> Import -> select the wcfg file from the **coe and wcfg** directory in order to be able to see the necessary signals.
